Processors are an integral part of the computer and electronics industry. Everycomputational unit contains some sort of processing circuit, designed to perform multiple operations on a single device and can be categorized based on its speed, flexibility and adaptability. RISC, CISC, Harvard and Von Neumann are some of these philosophies, emphasizing on a generalized approach for the design. This paperdescribes the design and implementation of a custom 8-bit single cycle processor on Xilinx Vivado Design suite, supporting 16 instructions, 256 bytes of internal storage, an Arithmetic Logic Unit and control unit. The module functionalities, Instruction set design and Data flow of the processor have also been discussed for a subset of instructions along with the simulation results
